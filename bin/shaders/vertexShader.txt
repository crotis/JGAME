//Vertex Shader has access to the positons of any given VAO in the form of the vector 3-position variable
//Vector shader executes for each vertex and uses the input position to tell the GPU where on the screen the vertex should be rendered. This is done by setting the "gl_Position" variable.
///Then vertex shader calculates a colour for each vertex based on its position
// we did this by setting colour red component to the x position + 0.5, green component to 1, and the blue component to the y position +0.5

//Declare input & output
in vec3 position;

out vec3 colour;

void main(void){

	gl_Position = vec4(position,1.0);
	colour = vec3(position.x+0.5,0.0,position.y+0.5);
